This bot was created to handle equipment loan processes for the tStudios Interest Group, in Tembusu Residential College.

## How to use

The bot allows pre-approved users to make loan requests for tStudios equipment using the command /loan, and check the status of all the loan requests they have made using the command /check.

In order to make a loan request, they will have to indicate:

- What equipment they want to borrow
- How many (tStudios has imposed a hard limit of 2 per loan request)
- Loan period (Start and End date)
- Reason for loan request

Administrators can approve loan requests using the command /approve, or indicate loans as having been returned using the command /return. They can also approve a user using their telegram handle and the command /add.

## How to start

As an approved user, you can find the bot on telegram using the handle @tStudios0_bot, or using this link: https://t.me/tStudios0_bot

A simple /start command will start up the bot for the user and display all possible commands.
